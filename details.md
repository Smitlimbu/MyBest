# MyBest

Hello! I’m Smit, a 16-year-old developer passionate about game development.
I’ve been programming for over 3 years, with C++ being my favorite language due to its power and performance.

About a year ago, I dove into Roblox scripting, and I’ve been learning non-stop ever since. I’m not claiming to be a master yet — but I believe in growing through every game I build.
